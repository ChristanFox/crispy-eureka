## Description

Using the full MERN stack, create a polished and professional site to display a company's services as well as a smooth shopping experience.
A user can select from a vendors list of services, add to their cart, login, signup, or view a list of services.
The site was generated with a mobile first approach. As such, the site displays properly across across all media widths.

## Testing

Once on the site, a user can click on a the nav bar header to be taken to a section of the site. Alternatively, a user can scroll across the site and click on various links to be taken to the desired page.
